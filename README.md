Feel free clone this repo and create yours

## Instalation

First lets clone the repo 

    git clone 

Now let's run a hardhat node

    npx hardhat node

Now let's deploy on local

    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

Now let's see the UI

    npm run dev

This should make the trick. Feel free to customize it as you wish.
